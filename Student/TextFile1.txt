class is a blueprint based on whoch multiple objects
of same type could be created

Class is a user defined type
Date Type > 
which tells that what type of value can be stored in a variable
Data types indicates 2 things

  1. what value can be stored
  2. what functions are allowed
     but where? on variable

     int > store numbers + - min max avg
     string > store characters , strcmp , length
     class student
     { 
     int rn;
     string name;
     void Get() {}
     void Display() {}
     }
     int num1;

     Student student; // dec
     student = new Student(); // init


     }

     class 

object instance of class

encapsulation  > hiding the details which are not needed by user

abstraction >  showing the details which are needed by user

we acheive them bu using access specifiers

by def class is internal 
by def class members are private

access specifiers 
1. private  > cannot access them outside the class
2. public > can access them outside the class
3. internal > can access them within the assembly/project


4. protected > in inheritance
5. internal protected

data hiding > hide data
